User Story:
As a User when I visit the website on desktop, I want to be presented with a split screen where I can then search for recipes or a movie.

As a User when I search for a recipe using an ingredient, I am presented with a random meal and can then visit a webpage and see the full recipe.

As a User when I search for a movie using a name, I am presented with the title of the movie, the poster, year of release and a list of the main actors. 

When I search for a new recipe or movie I am able to see my previous searches in the form of buttons.

I can click on the previous search buttons and they will direct me to the results of that search.
